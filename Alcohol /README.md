'##Using Probatch package to remove the batch effect in the Mice brain due to Alcohol use'

Probatch Package is a tool for Diagnostics and Corrections of Batch Effects in Proteomics. This package is for version 3.16 of Bioconductor.

To install this package you need to have R version "4.2". As of the time of writing this file, the latest version of R is 4.3.2. To install Bioconductor 3.16 and utilize the Probatch package, we require a tool or application that facilitates changing the R version. 

We will use [RSWITCH] (https://github.com/hrbrmstr/RSwitch)  for switching from R version 4.3.2 to R version 4.2.


#What is proteomic data

Proteomic data encompasses information about the comprehensive analysis of proteins within a biological system, involving the identification and quantification of proteins, exploration of post-translational modifications, elucidation of protein-protein interactions, determination of subcellular localization, and the provision of functional annotations. This data enables a deeper understanding of the structure, function, and regulation of proteins, shedding light on their roles in cellular pathways and facilitating comparative analyses across different conditions or biological states.
