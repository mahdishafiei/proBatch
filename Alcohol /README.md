Probatch Package is a tool for Diagnostics and Corrections of Batch Effects in Proteomics. This package is for version 3.16 of Bioconductor.

To install this package you need to have R version "4.2". As of the time of writing this file, the latest version of R is 4.3.2. To install Bioconductor 3.16 and utilize the Probatch package, we require a tool or application that facilitates changing the R version. 

We will use <"https://github.com/hrbrmstr/RSwitch">RSWITCH for switching from R version 4.3.2 to R version 4.2.
